        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <hr class="branded"/>
        <p class="lead">The Italian mafia has established a hidden but lethal presence in Africa. Its members own
          diamond mines, nightclubs and land, all with the complicity of corrupt regimes.</p>

        <p>Italian anti-Mafia authorities estimate that organised crime groups earn â‚¬26 billion a year in Italy alone.
          But the figure only scratches the surface of its economic power. Mafia Inc. is more than ever a global
          business, infiltrating legitimate economies worldwide. And the extent of the empire is unknown.</p>

        <p>An international team of reporters from the non-profit investigative journalism centres IRPI and ANCIR (with
          the Investigative Dashboard Africa) partnered with the data analysts of QUATTROGATTI and the production room
          of CORRECT!V to uncover for the first time the Italian Mafia's grip on Africa.</p>

        <p>Supported by two working grants for independent journalism, the Innovative Journalism Grant of the EJC and
          Journalism Fund, the work took seven months, and included trips to Sicily, Calabria, Campania, Lazio,
          Lombardy, in Italy and South Africa, Namibia, Senegal and Kenya, in Africa.</p>

        <p>Ten investigative reporters from six different countries, one data-journalist and a data-scientist, three
          editors, one cross-examiner and a bunch of lawyers joined the effort in producing in-depth research into the
          Mafia's involvement in 13 countries.</p>

        <p>Mafia in Africa draws a bleak picture, and highlights the need for the international community to reforms its
          policies, to monitor and fight the economic infiltration by criminals and prevent the dire consequences on
          unstable African societies.</p>
