          Money laundering within Charter House Bank
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>There was a bank, in Kenya, that managed bank accounts as a cover-up. Its real purpose was a massive money
          laundering machine.</p>

        <p>Called <a href="/2015/04/16/kenyas-drug-barons.html/">Charterhouse Bank, it
          was owned by John Harun Mwau</a>, one of Kenya's hundred richest men. The United States Embassy in Nairobi
          regarded Mwau as among the most powerful drug traffickers in Kenya, and a man who knows how to move untracked.
          Between 2004 and 2006, Mwau funneled dirty money into bank accounts of two companies registered within Charter
          House. He would then regularly skim and divert payments to colluding entrepreneurs. </p>

        <p>This is how capital was laundered to appear clean. Among the names listed as CHB money launderers was Paolo
          Sattanino, an Italian who denies any involvement in the scheme. This story began ten years ago, but has yet to
          have an ending. Perpetrators, despite the denounces of PricewaterhouseCopper, Central Bank of Kenya and the
          Kenyan media, have never been prosecuted by Kenyan authorities. IRPI reporters have travelled to Kenya to
          discover more.</p>

        <p>For an Italian tourist in Malindi, on the coast of Kenya, catching a drink at the Pata Pata Beach Club is a

        <p>Pata Pata is one of Kenya's most important night-time spots. Its manager, Mario Mele, is an Italian
          entrepreneur coming from the beautiful island of Sardinia, where he directed similar clubs on the island's
          shores. Mele left Sardinia after an arrest warrant was issued for evading €17 million in Italian taxes. When
          the Fiscal Guard checked Mele's bank accounts, agents found an invoice issued by a company owned by the
          Sicilian mafia clan D'Agosta.</p>

          Cosa Nostra, Vito Roberto Palazzolo
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>(Related countries: Germany, Switzerland, USA, Namibia, Angola, Russia, Hong Kong)</p>

        <p>Vito Roberto Palazzolo, aka Robert Von Palace Kolbatshenko, currently sits in Milan's Opera Prison, condemned
          to a nine-year sentence for 'Mafia association' after evading justice since the mid 1980s.</p>

        <p>South Africa, where he escaped to from Italy in 1986, refused to extradite him: Mafia association is not a
          crime there. Italian authorities only managed to snatch Palazzolo in March 2012 after Interpol apprehended him
          while he was passing through Thailand.</p>

        <p>Organised crime experts regard Palazzolo as one of the most intelligent and powerful recent Cosa Nostra's
          members. Yet few are aware of the broader picture, and even fewer know the exact features of his own empire.
          Palazzolo is a modern Midas: all he touches turns into gold. Throughout his career Palazzolo provided Cosa
          Nostra with complex money laundering schemes, profitable investments and a safe haven for fugitives.</p>

        <p>He facilitated joint diamond ventures for the corrupt oligarchies of South Africa, Angola and Namibia and
          opened the gates of Sub-Sahara to Italian industrialists. But just how big is Palazzolo's empire? And who
          manages it now that he is behind bars?</p>

          Cosa Nostra - Antonino Messicati Vitale
        </h3>

      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>(Related countries: Zimbabwe, DRC, Angola, Ghana)</p>

        <p>Harare, Zimbabwe, early January 2011. An Italian man buys one million carats of blood diamonds using rustling
          American dollars. It was a single transaction worth tens if not hundreds of millions. He is young,
          good-looking and incredibly rich and powerful. His name is Antonino Messicati Vitale, and he is a boss of the
          Sicilian mafia, Cosa Nostra.</p>

        <p>A few weeks later, in Pretoria, South Africa, Antonino sits at a bargaining table with six other people. They
          are discussing a contract that will give rise to a new venture in the diamond trade. The agreement, 'Zimbabwe
          Diamond Opportunity',secured, processed and marketed 30,000 carats of uncut diamonds per month to wealthy
          European.</p>

        <p>Diamonds are a perfect means for mafia money laundering. They don’t have a fixed value. And if they are blood
          diamonds, banned ones, in the hands of the mafia they travel parallel paths and still end up on some unaware
          rich ladies’ necks. What has the Cosa Nostra done over the last four years to obtain diamonds from Sub Saharan
          Africa?</p>

          Casalesi Clan of the Camorra
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>Between 2009 and 2010 the Casalesi clan of the Camorra, from the Campania region of Italy, tried to
          infiltrate the economy of the Central African Republic. Antonio Iovine, one of the most powerful Casalesi
          bosses, was on the run. He instructed his lawyer, Michele Santonastaso, to make him an honorary consul of the
          African country.</p>

        <p>Santonastaso is well-known for an incident occured in 2008 when, representing two mafia clients in court, he
          read a 60-page defense which largely consisted of menacing threats to magistrates and journalists. A year
          later he approached Maurizio S., an entrepreneur from the North East Italian region of Veneto, who was active
          in humanitarian projects and supported by the NGO Fondazione Mondo Migliore.</p>

        <p>Santonastaso promised Maurizio investments in the humanitarian project. He obtained a draft of the project
          and a list of all the local contacts including local priests, General Rivera Sancez of the American secret
          services, Elie Dote, a representative from the President of Central African Republic, and the very President
          Francois Bozize.</p>

        <p>Maurizio was involved in rural agricultural projects in CAR, and asked to install radio antennas for phones
          and the Internet. Only later did he discover that Santonastaso' s real interest was in resources exploitation
          and a honorary consul title for his mafia client, when the lawyer was arrested in October 2010, two months
          before Iovine.</p>

        <p>Maurizio told IRPI he abandoned his humanitarian projects in the country when civil war sparked again. He
          also told prosecutors that it is possible the Camorra used his contacts and achieved its aims in the country.
          In 2014, Santonastaso was convicted in first instance to 11 years of jail for mafia association.</p>

        <p>Alvaro and Piromalli clans of the 'Ndrangheta are two powerful families who control the Gioia Tauro area,
          close to Reggio Calabria, where it is located one of the most important ports in Italy.</p>

        <p>In 2006, the clans decided to bring their investments to Tunisia, South Africa and DRC, thanks to the
          intermediation of a Roman entrepreneur, Pietro D'Ardes, owner of a large supermarket chain. D'Ardes was
          sentenced to 11 years following the 'Cent'anni di storia' 'a hundred years of history') investigation.</p>

        <p>Plans for investments in Africa were discussed with Giuseppe Mancini, the lawyer of the Casamonica clan of
          the Roma mafia of Rome. The first step was the creation of a base of operations in Malta considered, in their
          own words, a 'free territory'. Giuseppe Mancini, also sentenced to nine years in jail for external
          participation in mafia type activity, was ready to invest Pietro D'Ardes's capital, especially in the DRC.</p>

        <p>Police wire taps from 2006 recorded Mancini explaining to a business partner that although Tunisia offers
          nice profits, accessing the DRC's raw and precious mines would make the mafia 'money–a lot of money, real
          money'. So confident is the 'Ndrangheta clan of the returns, it is willing to fund the construction of a new
          port to serve the mines they will acquire.</p>

          Cosa Nostra, Di Gati Clan
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>Sometimes there is no master plan to the presence of mafia affiliates in Africa.</p>

        <p>For Ignazio Gagliardo, a high ranking member of the Di Gati clan of the Sicilian mafia, South Africa was a
          place to evade justice, perhaps inspired by childhood fantasies. 'When I was a kid I was fond of adventure
          stories', he said in an interview. 'I loved when the television talked about the pyramids and I loved
          Africa.'</p>

        <p>In 1999, Gagliardo was sentenced for murder and mafia association, and fled to South Africa. He arrived in
          Johannesburg before moving to Crystal Park, where he bought a toy shop and started a new life. The story of
          Ignazio Gagliardo shows how mafia not only destroys the lives of its victims, but also of its own members.</p>

        <p>Son of a poor Italian miner, Ignazio had four brothers. Two of them entered the Carabinieri (the Italian
          military police) while the others, like Ignazio, became part of the Di Gati clan. The eldest, Salvatore, was
          killed in an internal mafia war. The remaining one, after serving a jail term for mafia association, killed
          himself and his parents in a murderous rampage in 2012. Ignazio, safe from extradition in South Africa,
          repented and delivered himself into the hands of prosecutors in 2006. His change of heart was an act of love:
          back in Italy his wife, recently diagnosed with leukemia, was in need of a bone marrow transplant. Ignazio
          sent a heartfelt letter to the Italian authorities, saying that he was ready to collaborate if he could live
          with his wife and son.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Pelle-Vottari
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>After a three-year investigation, operation 'Annibale' brought down an international drug-trafficking ring
          shipping cocaine from Colombia to Italy through Ghana. The key player of the gang was a Peruvian national who
          managed logistics from a monastery based in Milan, Italy.</p>

        <p>The cocaine cargos travelled from South America to the African country. Once in Spain, the narcotics
          travelled by truck through France, finally arriving in Italy where they were sold in the central and northern
          areas. Among the 33 people arrested in May 2015 there were two renown entrepreneurs from the city of Piacenza,
          Italy. They used their transportation company's logistics to safely deliver the drugs, police said. The
          businessmen relied on two 'Ndrangheta affiliates – belonging to the powerful family of the Pelle-Vottari – who
          were crucial in establishing a fruitful partnership between Colombian drug-cartels and the Italian ones.</p>

        <p>'Ndrangheta is a Mafia-style crime syndicate originating in the region of Calabria, Italy. It is believed by
          many to be among the most powerful criminal organizations worldwide. Many reports indicate the 'Ndrangheta as
          the leading crime syndicate in transnational drug-trafficking. The Peruvian national worked as keeper of the
          Milan's monastery, which was used to allow drug-mules to travel freely between South America and Italy, under
          the pretence of pilgrimages, prosecutors say.</p>

        <p>The gang was also found in the process of defrauding FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization for the United
          Nations), obtaining dubious funds for the development of facilities linked to the fishing industry in Ghana,
          that police believe was used as a crucial hub for the transportation of narcotics.</p>

          Cosa Nostra, Mandamento of Partinico
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>(Related countries: South Africa, Ivory Coast, Senegal)</p>

        <p>In 1995 the Italian police discovered that mafia fugitive Mariano Tullio Troia was hiding in South Africa.
          Troia was considered the number three of Cosa Nostra and was also wanted for ordering the homicide of
          Palermo's mayor Salvo Lima and 39 other killings. </p>

        <p>Local police discovered that Troia was at the Johannesburg's premises of the Sicilian coffee manufacturer,
          Salvatore Morettino, in the African country since the 60s. Attempts to arrest Troia failed due corruption in
          the local police force. The kingpin was arrested in Palermo only two years later, in 1998. Authorities
          believed Vito Roberto Palazzolo, another crucial member to the Cosa Nostra in South Africa, was also aiding
          Troia. In June of '96 police raided Palazzolo's La Terra de Luc farm in the Western Cape hoping to find
          Troia.</p>

        <p>He was not there, but police did find traces that two other mafia fugitives, Giovanni Bonomo and Giuseppe
          Gelardi, had been recent guests. Both were close associates of Giovanni Brusca, a sadistic mafia crime boss,
          and Bonomo was the 'capo mandamento' (commission boss) of Partinico. Bonomo escaped Italian justice just in
          time. After entering South Africa he was hidden by Palazzolo at La Terra de Luc and then smuggled into
          Namibia, where he stayed for a while in another farm of Palazzolo's.</p>

        <p>Bonomo spent several years in Namibia, exactly when the cocaine trafficking by Vito Bigione was taking place,
          later moving around Africa until he was apprehended in Senegal, in 2003. Palazzolo did admit hosting Bonomo
          and Gelardi, but he maintained he did so before any charges were brought against them. Troia and Bonomo
          weren't just hiding. They set up profitable businesses and laundered money locally, with the help of those
          associates who were already in Sub Saharan African like Palazzolo, police reported.</p>

          Cosa Nostra, Agate Clan; 'Ndrangheta of Macrì – Namibia
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>In the early 2000s Namibia was used as an hub for the cocaine trafficking by the Agate Clan of Mazara del
          Vallo, Sicily, as the Operation Igres uncovered. Cocaine was being shipped from the Colombian Narcos to Vito
          Bigione, aka 'the accountant'. He used large boats to transport it from Namibia to Sicily.</p>

        <p>In 1999 Bigione opened a restaurant, 'La Marina Restaurant', on the beach of Swakopmunt using an old,
          converted oil train. Italians who tasted his spaghetti assure they were the best in Namibia. But Bigione was
          not a normal pasta maker. He was in fact a Cosa Nostra member using La Marina as a cover. Co-managed with his
          French wife, La Marina was attended by local VIPs and politicians. Igres heralded a change in the management
          of cocaine trafficking and the power balance between the different Italian mafias. Until mid 90s, the Sicilian
          mafia was the undisputed provider of Colombian cocaine to Europe: it had strong contacts with the local narcos
          and the American Gambino and Bonnano families.</p>

        <p>By the end of the 90s the 'Ndrangheta from Calabria had quietly grown richer and stronger, becoming a major
          sponsor of the Agate's clan cocaine trafficking. Vito Bigione was in direct contact with the powerful
          'Ndrangheta brokers Alessandro and Roberto Pannunzi, who even paid a ransom to save the Agate Clan's boss
          Salvatore Miceli from the Colombian Narcos. The economic supremacy and organisation of the 'Ndrangheta made
          Vito Bigione self-coordinating with the Pannunzi.</p>

        <p>Yet Cosa Nostra did not want to lose the grip, and the Agate Clan sent various members to Namibia to assist
          Bigione in different occasions. Despite a request of extradition, Namibia never handed Bigione to Italy
          because the crime of 'mafia association' does not exist there and the drug trafficking charge, prosecutor Nico
          Horn explained to IRPI, could not be proved in court. Bigione was among the thirty most wanted criminals of
          the world, and was handcuffed in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2004. Roberto Pannunzi, being 'Europe's most wanted
          drugs trafficker', landed in jail only in 2013.</p>

          Camorra of Mondragone
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>In 2008, the Mondragone clan of the Camorra, the organised crime from the Campania Region, decided to invest
          in bread factories in the Ivory Coast. Clueless proxies were needed, and the Mondragone found them among the
          entrepreneurs of northern Italy. Using a reliable frontmen, Mr. Cesare Salomone, working as an official at the
          Supreme Court, the Mondragone clan hooked an engineer, Claudio T., for the drafting of the project and a group
          of entrepreneurs. </p>

        <p>Salomone brought businessmen and credible investors together, with the help of the engineer Claudio and
          Sergio B., a known entrepreneur in alternative energy markets. Sergio B. was eager to aid Salomone’s projects
          in the Ivory Coast because of a desire to install GPL gas plants and wind power turbines. </p>

        <p>Sergio B. told IRPI he learned with shock Salomone was a frontman for the Camorra as he never suspected that.
          He also said projects for alternative energy did not go further because Salomone was not reliable. </p>

        <p>Among those hooked by Salomone was a prominent doctor belonging to Berlusconi’s The People of Freedom party
          (PDL) who introduced the Ivory Coast consul to the project, and intended to propose the venture to Claudio
          Scajola, who was, at the time, Minister of the Economic Development. Scajola was arrested in 2014 for aiding
          and abetting a fugitive, a shipowner from Calabria considered to be too close to the Ndrangheta mafia. </p>

        <p>In December 2013 Mr.Salomone, the Camorra members and the engineer Claudio T. were arrested and jailed
          December 2013. Prosecutors considered the engineer aware of the fact the people he was drawing the projects
          for belonged to the Camorra, as meetings in Italy and trips to the Ivory Coast would prove. Charges against
          the engineer were dropped in March 2015.</p>

        <p>The bread-baking plants were constructed, and it remains likely that were or are managed by frontmen for the
          Camorra’s clan.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of De Stefano
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>(Related countries: Tanzania)</p>

        <p>In July 2013, a large police operation known as 'Breakfast' broke down on the one of the city's most powerful
          'Ndrangheta families, the De Stefano. The aim of the operation was to untangle their networks and friendships
          among politicians protecting their financial empire from seizure. The investigation revealed a web of brokers
          and intermediaries helping a politician close to the mafia clans redirect illicit capital into offshore
          havens. This is the case with Amedeo Matacena, a famous shipowner and politician sentenced in 2001 for the
          crime of complicity with the mafia.</p>

        <p>Matacena owns two companies in Liberia, 'Amju International Tanker' and 'Athoschia International', which were
          both being assigned to proxies, as operation 'Breakfast' disclosed. Matacena's magic circle was composed
          mainly of his wife Chiara Rizzo and the politician Claudio Scajola, who together tried to sneak Matacena into
          Lebanon after Italian authorities asked Dubai, where he lives, to extradite him. According to prosecutors,
          Matacena's case provides strong evidence for the existence of a group of invisible brokers working for the
          most important clans of the Italian mafia. </p>

        <p>One of these 'professionals' is lawyer Bruno Mafrici who appears to be linked to another scandal involving
          the bursar of the Lega Nord party, Francesco Belsito. The politician is accused of bagging 'Ndrangheta money
          and buying commodities, which would keep their value in time and be a secure investment for the Lega Nord. One
          of these commodities was diamonds, which he tried to acquire in Tanzania via a Cypriot bank using money
          donated to the party by entrepreneur Stefano Bonet. The financial intermediary in charge for this risky
          operation was Paolo Scala, a broker in Cipro, considered by the prosecutors a man of Bonet.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Parrello
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>According to the investigations of the Italian Anti-Mafia authority, there is a decades-old relationship
          between the Italian mafias and the underworld of North Africa. In recent years this relationship has grown
          stronger, especially for drugs and toxic waste trafficking.</p>

        <p>In March 2006 operation 'Ibisco' uncovered how the Parrello clan of the 'Ndrangheta (the organized crime
          syndicate of Calabria), in collaboration with specialists of the drug trade based in Rome, organised the
          trafficking of hundreds of tonnes of hashish from Morocco and cocaine from South America. The drugs coming
          from Colombia arrived via ship to logistic bases the criminals secured in Morocco and Cabo Verde, then they
          were transferred to Spanish and northern European ports.</p>

        <p>The Italian police identified and seized some of these shipments, finding up to seventeen tonnes of hashish
          and over two tonnes of pure cocaine in a single cargo. According to Prosecutor Lucia Lotti 'It was a
          consortium of criminal interests. These people were really hard to identify: they move on private jets, from
          Montecarlo to South America, to buy parcels of drugs'. The Roman branch of the organization was also
          specialised in laundering the profits of the trade, using proxies and shell companies to buy real estate in
          Europe and Northern Africa.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Pelle-Nirta
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>On 20 January, 2015, Italian police blasted a 'Ndrangheta cell in Rome linked to the Clans of
          Pelle-Nirta-Giorgi alias 'Cicero', which was particularly active in international drug trafficking. The drugs
          were arriving from Colombia and Marocco. In the North African country there was a broker living there and
          working for the syndicate called Marco Torello Rollero. He boasted in an police wiretap that after the arrest
          of Roberto Pannunzi, he was the last great drug broker.</p>

        <p>Marco Rollero liked to be called 'Remo'. His affiliates would make sure that enormous amounts of cocaine
          would be loaded safely on ships in Colombia, and directed to Morocco. From there, where he had his operational
          base, Remo made sure that the hashish coming from inland and cocaine cargoes from South America reached
          Italy.</p>

        <p>Supply was as great as the demand. The narcotics reached street markets in Rome, Florence, Genoa and Turin.
          In January 2015, the Fiscal Guard and the police of Rome put an end to a criminal organization based there
          which had significant ties with the powerful 'Ndrangheta clan of the Pelle-Nirta families. According to
          prosecutors, the gang wanted the monopoly of the drug trade in Rome, not only providing brokering services to
          the 'Ndrangheta but also to Naples-based Camorra. Marco Torello Rollero was arrested on 13 April 2014, after a
          chase that lasted for five years.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Piromalli
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>The Piromalli clan of the 'Ndrangheta had an idea to make money. It intended to use NGOs to sell medicine
          donated by the Italian State to African countries. The plot was uncovered by the 'Cent'anni di storia' (100
          years of history) investigation led by Antimafia prosecutor Roberto di Palma.</p>

        <p>On 23 July 2012, Aldo Miccichè was arrested in Caracas, Venezuela, and subsequently sentenced to 11 years for
          acting as a middleman between the ruthless Piromalli clan and Senator Marcello Dell'Utri of the People of
          Freedom party.</p>

        <p>Prosecutor Di Palma was following the traces left by a 'Ndrangheta member called Gioacchino Arcidiaco, when
          he stumbled into Miccichè and Dell'Utri. The investigation files show how in 2007 mafia boss Antonio Piromalli
          (whose father is detained under 41bis jail condition, designed for mobsters) told Aldo Miccichè about
          'Operation Doro' in Africa.</p>

        <p>The operation is believed to be named after a mafia clan-member in the United States, 'Doran Cat'. It was to
          be expanded to Latin America and Asia. Intercepted conversations reveal that its true purpose was to sell, via
          brokers, medicines donated by the Italian state and its taxpayers to NGOs in Africa.</p>

        <p>Gioacchino Arcidiaco and Miccichè began by discussing a scam involving a man called Lima going to Nigeria to
          buy cement in a deal Arcidiaco described as 'a work of art'. It is not known whether the deal actually took
          place because, as Arcidiaco explains, Lima needed a 'mandate' – permission from 'Ndrangheta bosses – to
          operate, 'otherwise, how can he walk around?'.</p>

        <p>Arcidiaco and Miccichè then turned to the topic of medicine. Arcidiaco proposed using an NGO to get free
          medicines from the Italian state, and then sell them to African countries. To back up his idea, Miccichè told
          Arcidiaco that brokers have already sold a lot of medicines in this way. It emerged later that Miccichè was
          also involved in the selling of oil, via American brokers, to China, United States and Africa, by falsely
          declaring Australia as its destination.</p>

        <p>Aldo Micciché has been an important political character in Italy during the years of Democrazia Cristiana. He
          moved Venezuela in 1991, where he lived as a free man and respected entrepreneur. In reality, he was a broker
          for the 'Ndrangheta.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Seregno
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>The 'Ndrangheta syndicate of Seregno, close to Milan, owned a fake bank in town. The boss of the clan of
          Seregno was Giuseppe Pensabene, who ruthlessly ruled over the Brianza area.</p>

        <p>In 2015 prosecutors charged him with usury, extortion, abusive exercise of the credit, false registration of
          goods and companies, among which was the fake bank. Investigations uncovered how the crime syndicate laundered
          dirty money from illicit business in Switzerland and San Marino, attempting also to traffick counterfeit gold
          from Senegal to Switzerland. For the latter operation the clan needed a respectable frontman.</p>

        <p>Marcel Astolfi, an Italian born in Denmark known by authorities for having committed various frauds, was
          considered the perfect proxy for the syndicate in Dakar. In order to sneak the gold to Italy, via Switzerland,
          Astolfi set up a company called 'Euro Africa Trade', but the import attempts failed twice.</p>

          Magna Charta – Senegal
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>With 30 people arrested and six tons of cocaine seized, the 2012 'Magna Charta' operation dismantled an
          international drug trafficking ring. Head of the criminal gang was a Bulgarian national, Emil Banev, aka
          'Brendo', who is a well-known entrepreneur in Bulgaria according to Italian prosecutors.</p>

        <p>Among those arrested were seven Italians, a small part of a group from Bulgaria, Spain, The Netherlands,
          Slovenia, Romania, Croatia, Finland and Georgia. The narcotics were destined to the region of Piedmont, Italy.
          Crucial to the smuggling were Italians Lucio and Fabio Castellan, two brothers in charge of finding skippers
          and ships suitable for the operations. Boats, according to Italian investigators, left from the port and
          airport in La Romana, Dominican Republic. Planes would land in Milan, Italy, or Amsterdam.</p>

        <p>During the operation, Italian police also seized €30 million worth of assets, among which there were several
          bank accounts in Switzerland.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Platì
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>Tunisia was chosen by the boss of the 'Ndrangheta in Platì as place of refuge and business. The powerful and
          ruthless 'Ndrangheta clan of Platì Salvatore Strangio, the boss, was put in charge of infiltrating,
          controlling and managing the economic activities of the Milan roadworks and excavating company Perego Strade.
          Strangio had to guarantee an equal division of tenders in roadworks among the 'Ndrangheta clans in Lombardy
          giving the 'Ndrangheta of Erba, led by Pasquale Varca, a good amount of business.</p>

        <p>Along with Pasquale Varca, Strangio was invited to a summit at Giuseppe Pelle's house, one of the most
          powerful bosses of Calabrian organised crime. The meeting, held near Milan, was also attended by Michele
          Oppedisano, nephew of Domenico, who was 'capo crimine', namely the highest ranking member of the
          'Ndrangheta.</p>

        <p>Oppedisano was representing the interests of the 'Ndrangheta from the flatland of Gioia Tauro, where the
          strongest and bloodiest clans are located. Not long after the summit, in September-October 2009, the Italian
          press started to report on the 'Ndrangheta infiltration of the construction works for the International
          exhibition Expo 2015 in Milan, disclosing details about the excavating companies of both Strangio and
          Varca.</p>

        <p>Strangio, alerted by Varca in person, feared an arrest and decided to leave Perego Strade and to flee to
          Tunisia. Ye, he always intended to return to Milan and work for Expo 2015 once the situation calmed. Wiretaps
          showed how Strangio was planning a subterranean electric system in Libya and the opening of a Tunisian company
          for the exporting of excavators from Italy. Salvatore Strangio was arrested in 2010 during operations Infinito
          and Tenecia, later sentenced to 12 years in jail.</p>

          'Ndrangheta of Erba
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body markdown">
        <p>Although the 'Ndrangheta crime gang is native to Calabria, south of Italy, it built itself a new stronghold,
          or 'locale', in Erba, Lombardy. It is this small mafia enclave that the 'Ndrangheta tried to replicate in
          Tunisia. The Erba's boss was Pasquale Varca, one of the highest ranked members in the 'Ndrangheta system.
          Pasquale Varca was in fact representing the interests of the detached 'Ndrangheta clans in the excavation
          business in Lombardy – making him, theoretically, a competitor of the Platì clan. The Platì clan appointed
          Salvatore Strangio with the task of infiltrating the roadworks company Perego Strade.</p>

        <p>Having numerous properties in the North African country, Varca also organised the hiding of 'Ndrangheta
          fugitives Paolo Lentini and Antonio Morelli, belonging to the Arena clan and both caught before leaving Italy
          for Tunisia. Varca was also managing the trafficking of old excavators exported from Italy to Tunisia.</p>

        <p>Thanks to this revenue-making cover-up, Varca managed to organise the shipping of caterpillars and excavating
          machinery of unknown origin to Tunisia thanks to intermediaries. The 2010 police operation 'Infinito', one of
          the largest attacks against the 'Ndrangheta, saw Varca arrested and discovered that the excavators were
          obtained by Varca from Italian bankrupt or financially troubled Italian entrepreneurs. The machinery was
          shipped to Tunisia by Badri and the 'Ndrangheta from ports in Genoa, Naples and Marselle. It was discovered
          that the owners of the excavators were forced by the 'Ndrangheta to hand over the equipment – and after
          telling the police the machines were stolen, they were pressured into handing over the insurance money too.
          Varca was sentenced to 15 years in jail.</p>
